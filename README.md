=====

Emacs configuration that sets up Erlang environment: erlang-mode, flymake, wrangler. Currently the flymake's configuration is already quite helpful as it handles not only erlang source files (.erl), but also supports erlang header files (.hrl) and erlang terms (.config, ...). I hope this repo will act as a starting poing for kind of `erlang-flymake2' mode. :)
